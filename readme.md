# Fetch Data Example
This is a simple example of how to fetch data from a JSON file and display it in a table.

# Prerequisites
This is up and running at [Vercel](https://simple-fetch-nine.vercel.app/) as of 2023 Dec.

Depending on your need, you will need the following to run this example locally:

- A web browser
- A text editor
- A JSON file named data.json
- A place to host the data.json 

# Instructions
[Save](https://github.com/T0ny-X/simple-fetch/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to your computer.
- Open the index.html file in your web browser.
- Click the "Fetch Data" button.
- The table will be populated with the data from the data.json file.

## Different Data Source
- Edit the js file at the row `const jsonUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/T0ny-X/simple-fetch/master/data.json";`
- Replace the url with your own.
- *If not sensitive, try Discord by sending it to someone you know, then right click to copy the CDN link (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...)*

# Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- index.html: The HTML file for the web page
- main.css: The CSS file for the web page
- index.js: The JavaScript file for the web page

# Data
The data for the project is stored in the data.json file. The file contains an array of degrees.

# License
I don't think this is complicated enough for copyright yet. Please assume that this project is licensed under the MIT License.

I hope this is helpful!
